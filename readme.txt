1. INTRODUCTION

This program pulls weather data from the openweathermap.org API and then emails you the information.

2. REQUIREMENTS

Program is written in Python 3.6, but should work with any version, as long as it is Python 3.
There are no other requirements.

3. INSTRUCTIONS

Edit the paramaters in var.py with your own paramaters.  There are instructions in the file that tell you how to do this.
The main idea is that you set this script up as a cronjob to run once a day, so it will email you the latest weather information each day.
